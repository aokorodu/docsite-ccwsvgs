# 2D Physics

## Matter.js

Matter.JS is a popular javascript library used to simulate two-dimensional physics on web pages. While the library includes a renderer that
draws graphics using the canvas element, we can also use the physics engine to animate individual SVG elements. We use the engine to create a variety of shapes similar to svg elements - circles, rectangles, and paths made of verticies (points). Whe can then use the positional data from these bodies to position svg elements.
