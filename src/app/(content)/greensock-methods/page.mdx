## Tween Methods

A **tween** is simply a method used to animate a property (or multiple properies) of an object over time. GSAP actually has three very descriptively named tween methods:

**gsap.to()**: Tweens an object from it's current state to a different state.

**gsap.from()**: Tweens an object from a state defined by the tween to it's current state

**gsap.fromTo()**: Tweens an object from a state defined in the tween to a different state.

## gsap.to()

As stated above, the **gsap.to()** method allows you to animate an object from its current state to a new state over a specified duration. Let's start with an example. In the HTML section of our practice codepen page let's create three circles, each with a different id and a class of _ball_.

<Blocks>{`<circle id="red" class="ball" cx="30" cy="150" r="30" fill="red" />
<circle id="green" class="ball" cx="30" cy="250" r="25" fill="green" />
<circle id="blue" class="ball" cx="30" cy="350" r="20" fill="blue" />`}</Blocks>

<svg width="500" height="500" viewBox="0 0 500 500">
  <rect
    id="bg"
    x="0"
    y="0"
    width=""
    height=""
    fill="#eaeaea"
    stroke="black"
    stroke-width="2"
  />
  <circle id="red" class="ball" cx="30" cy="150" r="30" fill="red" />
  <circle id="green" class="ball" cx="30" cy="250" r="25" fill="green" />
  <circle id="blue" class="ball" cx="30" cy="350" r="20" fill="blue" />
</svg>

In the JS section let's create variables for the three circles:

<Blocks>{`const red = document.querySelector("#red");
const green = document.querySelector("#green");
const blue = document.querySelector("#blue");`}</Blocks>

In order to animate an element you'll need to change one or more of it's presentation attributes using the following syntax:

```
gsap.to(<object>, {
    attr: {
      <property>: <value>,
      <property>: <value>,
      ...
    },
    // other animation properties
  });
```

Let's say we want to move the red ball horizontally across the screen. To do so we'll need to tween the _cx_ value like so:

<Blocks>{`gsap.to(red, {
  attr: {
      cx: 470
  }
});`}</Blocks>

We can animate all of the circles if we pass an array of objects instead of a single objects:

<Blocks highlight="1">{`gsap.to([red, green, blue], {
  attr: {
    cx: 470
  }
});`}</Blocks>

We can also animate using id and class names. Here's an example animating by id:

<Blocks highlight="1">{`gsap.to("#red", {
  attr: {
    cx: 470
  }
});`}</Blocks>

And even more powerfully, animating by class. The following tween will animate all of the circles, similar to the array example above:

<Blocks highlight="1">{`gsap.to(".ball", {
  attr: {
    cx: 470
  }
});`}</Blocks>

The default duration of any tween is 0.5 seconds, but we can specify our own using the **duration** property. Let's set it to two seconds:

<Blocks highlight="5">{`gsap.to(".ball", {
  attr: {
      cx: 470
  },
  duration: 2
});`}</Blocks>

Right now the animation runs just one time, but we can change that using the **repeat** property and assigning a value. To get the animation to repeat infinitely, assign a value of -1.

<Blocks highlight="5">{`gsap.to(".ball", {
  attr: {
      cx: 470
  },
  duration: 2,
  repeat: -1
});`}</Blocks>

We're not just limited to animating geometric properties. In the animation below we'll tween the fill , opacity and radius of each circle as well.

<Blocks>{`gsap.to(".ball", {
  attr: {
      cx: 470,
      r: 100,
      fill: "purple",
      opacity: 0.5,
  },
  duration: 2,
  repeat: -1
});`}</Blocks>

### Tween properties

We can make our animation more interesting by adding special properties to our animation object. I've already shown you two - _duration_ and _repeat_. Here are a few more that you'll probably use from time to time when using gsap.

**duration:**
The duration of the animation from beginning to end

**repeat:**
The number of times the animation repeats. A value of -1 makes the animation run indefinitely.

**yoyo:**
This property is similar to the _alternate_ CSS animation property, and it makes the animation run in the opposite direction every other time it repeats.

**ease:**
This is basically the gsap version of the css timing function. You can find a number of interesting pre-defined easing functions and a visualizer for each function <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases/" target="_blank">
here.</a>

**stagger:**
When defining an animation for multiple objects, this property staggers the start time for each object by the designated amount.

<Blocks highlight="5-9">{`gsap.to([red, green, blue], {
  attr: {
    cx: 470,
  },
  duration: 2,
  repeat: -1,
  yoyo: true,
  ease: "back.inOut",
  stagger: 0.5,
});`}</Blocks>

<BasicToAnim2 />

You'll notice that the repeat only occurs after all three of the staggered animations have completed. What if you want each ball to repeat/yoyo right away, instead of waiting for thee others? You'll need to use the **stagger object**, which gives you more fine-tuned control over the animation.

By using the stagger object and and defining the repeat and yoyo _inside_ that object, you get a different result. The _each_ property sets the delay in the start time for each sub-tween.

<Blocks>{`gsap.to([red, green, blue], {
  attr: {
    cx: 470,
  },
  duration: 2,
  ease: "back.inOut",
  // Repeats immediately, not waiting for the other staggered animations to finish
  stagger: {
    each: 0.5,
    repeat: -1,
    yoyo: true, 
  },
});`}</Blocks>

## gsap.from()

The _from_ method is used to animate an element _from_ the designated state to it's current state. In the example below we're going to animate the balls from the same point. (470, 250).

<Blocks>{`gsap.to([red, green, blue], {
  attr: {
    cx: 470,
    cy: 250,
  },
  duration: 2,
  ease: "back.inOut",
  repeat: -1,
  yoyo: true,
});`}</Blocks>

<BasicFromAnim />

## gsap.fromTo()

The _fromTo_ method is used to animate elements from one state to another.

<Blocks>{`gsap.fromTo(
  [red.current, green.current, blue.current],
  // from state
  {
    attr: {
      cx: 250,
      cy: 50,
      fill: "red",
    },
  },
  // to state
  {
    attr: {
      cx: 250,
      cy: 450,
      fill: "blue",
    },
    duration: 2,
    stagger: {
      each: 0.5,
      repeat: -1,
      yoyo: true,
    },

    ease: "back.inOut",

}
);`}</Blocks>
