## intro

GSAP provides several easy-to-use methods to control the playback of your individual animations and timelines. In this section we'll add playback controls to the animation that we created in the prior lesson. I've created a starter page for this lesson <a href="https://codepen.io/aokorodu/pen/xbxGEWp" target="_blank">
here</a>.

<GSAPPlaybackStarter />

You'll notice that the starter page contains four buttons below the SVG - **play**, **pause**, **reverse** and **restart**, as well as range slider input that will be used later as a video scrub bar. I've created variables for all the UI elements:

<Blocks>{`// ui
const playButton = document.querySelector("#play");
const pauseButton = document.querySelector("#pause");
const reverseButton = document.querySelector("#reverse");
const restartButton = document.querySelector("#restart");
const scrubber = document.querySelector("#scrubber");`}</Blocks>

I've also changed the animation itself so that it only runs once by removing the **repeat:-1** and **yoyo:true** properties;

<Blocks>{`theTween = gsap.timeline();`}</Blocks>

## play, pause, reverse, & restart

The playback controls are incredibly simple to use - all you need to do is call the tween's **play()**, **pause()**, **reverse()** or **restart()** method.

Let's create our methods in the starter codepen.

<Blocks>{`function play(){
    theTween.play();
}   
function pause(){
    if(theTween != null) theTween.pause();
}
function reverse(){
    if(theTween != null) theTween.reverse();
}
function restart(){
    if(theTween != null){
        theTween.restart();
        return;
    }
    theTween.play();
}`}</Blocks>

Let's hook these methods up to our buttons.

<Blocks>{`function initUI(){
  playButton.addEventListener("click", play);
  pauseButton.addEventListener("click", pause)
  reverseButton.addEventListener("click", reverse);
  restartButton.addEventListener("click", restart)
}
function play(){
    theTween.play();
}   
function pause(){
    if(theTween != null) theTween.pause();
}
function reverse(){
    if(theTween != null) theTween.reverse();
}
function restart(){
    if(theTween != null){
        theTween.restart();
        return;
    }
    theTween.play();
}`}</Blocks>

## adding a scrub bar

Next we'll add a slider that will allow you to "scrub" through the animation. The slider will also act as an animation progress bar.

In order to create a scrubber we'll need to know how long the animation is and the progress of the animation at any given time. Once we have those values, we'll be able to set the progress of the animation with our slider.

First let's create a variable to store our animation duration.

<Blocks highlight="3">{`// tween variables
let theTween = null;
let animationDuration = 0;`}</Blocks>

We can set the value of animationDuration using the **duration()** method once we create our timeline.

```
theTween.duration();
```

<Blocks>{`function animate() {
  theTween = gsap.timeline();
  theTween
    .fromTo(...
     // tween code
    );
  animationDuration = theTween.duration();
}`}</Blocks>

GSAP allows you to pass a callback function to your tween that will execute every time the animation updates. We pass the callback to our tween using the **vars** object, which we've used previously to configure our **repeat** and **yoyo** values. The property we'll need to set is **onUpdate**, and we'll pass it a function called **updateScrubber** which we'll create in a second.

<Blocks>{`function animate() {
  theTween = gsap.timeline({ onUpdate:updateScrubber});
  // rest of our animate code`}</Blocks>

The **updateScrubber()** method will be used to update the slider position. In order to do so we'll need to know how much time has elapsed in the animation, and then devide that by the animationDuration

<Blocks>{`function updateScrubber(){
  const perc = theTween.time()/animationDuration;
  scrubber.value = perc;
}`}</Blocks>

<Blocks>{``}</Blocks>
```
