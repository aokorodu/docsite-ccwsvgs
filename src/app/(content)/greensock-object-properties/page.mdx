## Intro

One of the most interesting aspects of GSAP tweens and timelines is that they can be used to tween numeric properties of generic objects. For example, imagine you have a simple object with numeric x and y property.

<Blocks>{`let propertyObject = {
  x: 240,
  y:0,
};`}</Blocks>

Since x and y are numeric properties we can use gsap to tween their values.

<Blocks>{`function animate() {
  const propertyTween = gsap.timeline();
  propertyTween.to(propertyObject, { x: 260, y: 500, duration: 2.5 });
}`}</Blocks>

That's great, but how can we use this? One way is to use the onUpdate method and use the updated property values in some way. For example we could use the new x and y values to define the control point of a Quadratic Bezier curve. We'll need to use the **onUpdate** property and create a callback method to update the path on every animation frame.

<Blocks highlight="2">{`function animate() {
  const propertyTween = gsap.timeline({ onUpdate: update, repeat: -1, yoyo: true });
  propertyTween.to(propertyObject, {
    x: 260,
    y: 500,
    duration: 2.5,
  });
}`}</Blocks>
Next we'd use something like the **update** method below to modify the a path.

<Blocks>{`function update() {
  const pathString = \`M-10,250 Q\${propertyObject.x},\${propertyObject.y} 510,250\`;
  thePath.setAttribute("d", pathString);
}`}</Blocks>

Below is a slightly more complex animation where I'm animating an object that represents the endpoint of a path. I've attached a _marker-end_ to the path (the flower petals), and the end result is a flower that looks like it's swaying in the breeze. The codepen for the flower example can be found <a href="https://codepen.io/aokorodu/pen/ogNvZJN" target="_blank">here.</a>

The final codepen below is a much more complex example, where I'm tweening the numeric properties of a number of objects - each representing path variables for a different facial feature - in order to create a series of facial expressions. Feel free to play around with the variable to see what you can come up with!
