## Intro

One of the most interesting aspects of GSAP tweens and timelines is that they can be used to tween numeric properties of generic objects. For example, imagine you have a simple object with numeric x and y property.

<Blocks>{`let numberObject = {
  x: 0,
  y:1000
};`}</Blocks>

Since x and y are numeric properties we can use gsap to tween their values.

<Blocks>{`function animate() {
  const pointTween = gsap.timeline();
  pointTween.to(pointObject, { x: 1000, y:0, duration: 20 });
}`}</Blocks>

That's great, but how can we use this? Well, what if we just wanted to tween the value of a single point in a path?
