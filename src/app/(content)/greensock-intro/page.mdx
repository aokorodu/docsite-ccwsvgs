## Intro

**GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a powerful JavaScript library used for creating high-performance animations that work in all major browsers. It allows developers to animate CSS properties, SVG, canvas, and more with great control and precision. GSAP is known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for both simple and complex animations in web development.

An in depth exporation of GSAP could be it's own course, so we're just going to focus on _some_ of the many ways GSAP can be used to animate SVG elements.
